# Opener's Second Bid

- A new color as second bid from the opener after a first response of responder at level 1 shows always 5+ cards in first suit and 4+ in the second.
  - Ex:
  - 1♥ - (p) - 1♠ - (p) - 2♣
  - 1♦ - (p) - 1♠ - (p) - 2♥ (reverse)
  - 1♠ - (p) - 1NT - (p) - 2♥/♦
  - 1♥ - (p) - 1NT - (p) - 2♠/♦ (2♠ is reverse)
  - 1♣ - (p) - 1NT - (p) - 2♥/♦/♠ (all reversed)
  - 1♦ - (p) - 1NT - (p) - 2♣/♥/♠ (2♥ and 2♠ are reversed)

- Exceptions:
  - 1♥/♠ - (p) - 1NT - (p) - 2♣ DOES NOT PROMISES 4 cards. It promises 2.

- A reverse happens when second bid is cheaper than first bid. It shows 17+tpts.

- A non-reverse bid promises 13-17tpts. 

- A single jump in a new color from opener shows 18-19 tpts and is game forcing.

- A double jump in a new color from opener shows 20-21 tpts.
