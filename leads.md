## Trump Contract Leads

Choosing suit:

- Consider bidding partner's suit (see the chapter below)
- Prioritize opponent unbid suits. Avoid opponent bid suits event if you have a nice holding.
- Lead a long suit only if your have 4 trumps or of your partner has a relative chance to hold 4 trumps.
- Lead trump only when conditions are met:
   a. Opponents sacrifice
   b. According the bidding, ruff is possible
   c. Opponents play at level 5?
- If your hesitate between many suits, choose the one which has the best possibilities from the choice of the card.

Choosing the card (when partner is silent):

- Top honnor touching (AK, KQ, QJ, JT, T9); It always promises the card below (unless singleton or doubleton). K & Q denies any card above but J & 10 may have one untouching honnor above. Thoses sequences are K**J**10x, K**T**9x, Q**10**9x.
- Singleton (with proper stopper in trump like A or Kx) (is this relevant?)
- Doubleton (high card)
- Leading a low card promises an honnor (K, Q, or J)
- Never lead an unsupported A
- Never lead under an A
- Don't lead under a K if you have a better option
- When leading a suit that has no honnor, we play MUD. We play the highest middle onle.
 
Choosing the card when it's partner's suit:

- Lead the A if you have it
- Lead top card from doubleton
- Lead top of touching honnor
- With no sequence but with one honnor lead low
- Otherwise play MUD

## NT Contract Leads 

- Consider leading partner's suit except if you have a singleton in this suit. 
- Choose your longuest unbid suit even if you have good cards in a short suit.
- If partner is marked with strenght, make a passive lead.

If partner is silent:

- Sequences:
  - A**K**Jx 
  - A**Q**Jx
  - A**J**T9
  - A**T**9x
  - **K**QJx
  - K**Q**T9
  - K**J**T9
  - K**T**9x
  - **Q**JTx
  - Q**T**9x
  - **J**T9x
  - **T**9xx
- Otherwise, 4th best

If you deceide to bid partner's suit :

  - Top card of doubleton
  - Top touching honnor
  - With no honnor (A, K, Q), lead the highest
  - Leading low promises an honnor
