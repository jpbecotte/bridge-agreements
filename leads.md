## Trump Contract Leads When Partner Is Silent





Priorities

1. Top honnor touching (AK, KQ, QJ, JT, T9) [1]
2. Singleton (with proper stopper in trump like A or Kx)
3. Doubleton (high card)
4. Leading trump when conditions are met
   a. Opponents sacrifice
   b. According the bidding, ruff is possible
   c. Opponents play at level 5?
5. Leading a low card [2]

Notes:
```
[1] Promises the card below
[2] Playing a low card doesn't promises an honnor
[3] Never under lead under A
```
