## Trump Contract Leads

Choosing suit:

- Consider bidding partner's suit (see the chapter below)
- Prioritize opponent unbid suits. Avoid opponent bid suits event if you have a nice holding.
- Lead a long suit only if your have 4 trumps or of your partner has a relative chance to hold 4 trumps.
- Lead trump only when conditions are met:
   a. Opponents sacrifice
   b. According the bidding, ruff is possible
   c. Opponents play at level 5?
- If your hesitate between many suits, choose the one which has the best possibilities from below

Choosing the card (when partner is silent):

- Top honnor touching (AK, KQ, QJ, JT, T9); It always promises the card below (unless singleton or doubleton). K & Q denies any card above but J & 10 may have one broken honnor. Thoses sequences are K**J**10x, K**T**9x, Q**109x 
- Singleton (with proper stopper in trump like A or Kx) (is this relevant?)
- Doubleton (high card)
- Leading a low card promises an honnor (K, Q, or J)
- Never lead an unsupported A
- Never lead under an A
- Don't lead under a K if you have a better option
- 

Priorities

1. Top honnor touching (AK, KQ, QJ, JT, T9) [1]
2. Singleton (with proper stopper in trump like A or Kx)
3. Doubleton (high card)
4. Leading trump when conditions are met
5. Leading a low card [2]

Notes:
```
[1] Promises the card below
[2] Playing a low card doesn't promises an honnor
[3] Never under lead under A
```
