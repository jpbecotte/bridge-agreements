# Over opponents take out double



## When to use

````
  M := major
  m := minor
  x := ! M
````

Opening in majors in 1st or 2nd place, opponents make a direct X, meaning it's a takeout double.

| Sequence | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1M - (X) - XX | No fit and 10+ tpts |
| 1M - (X) - 2NT | Fit (3 cards support) and 10+ tpts |
| 1♥ - (X) - 1♠  | 6-9 tpts |
| 1M - (X) - 2M  | Fit (3 cards support) and 6-9 tpts |
| 1M - (X) - 2m  | No fit, 6-9 tpts, and 5 in minor (alertable) |
| 1M - (X) - 1NT  | 6-9 tpts and balanced hand and no fit |

## After 1M - (X) - XX

The 4th player (Take-out Doubler's Partner) is forced to bid. Opener will either Pass or Double if he holds 4 cards in Opponent's suit.
If the 4th player's bid is passed around, the Redoubler must take action, usually by either a Penalty double or a NT bid. (reference: http://www.jazclass.aust.com/bridge/br28.htm#03)

## After 1M - (X) - 2NT

- 3M : Minimum hand (13-15 pts)
- 4M : Showing extras (16-21 pts)
- 3x : Help suit game try (2 or more losers in the suit)
- 4x : Forcing to game (0-1 cards in this suit, 16-21 pts)

## Partner opens in minors (1st or 2nd position)
- If partner opens 1♣ in then opponent double, the meaning of bid by responder is as the following 
- XX = 6+ pts, 4+ in both majors; 
- 1 ♠/♥ = 6+ pts, 4+ ♠/♥; 
- 1NT = 6-10 pts without majors; 
- 2NT = 11-12 pts without majors.

## Partner opens in minors (3rd or 4th position) use rule of 15 to decide open or not.
- If partner opens 1♣ in then opponent double, the meaning of bid by responder is as the following 
- XX = 6+ pts, 4+ in both majors; 
- 1 ♠/♥ = 6+ pts, 4+ ♠/♥; 
- 1NT = 6-10 pts without majors; 
- 2NT = 11-12 pts without majors. 



## When NOT to use 
- Opener opens in (3rd or 4th) and in majors, see Drury.
- Opener opens in minor
