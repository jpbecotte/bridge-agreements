# Lebensohl

Lebensohl is a contract bridge convention used by responder after an opponent's overcall of a one notrump (1NT) opening bid in order to compete further in the auction without necessarily committing the partnership to game. Lebensohl can also be used after opponents' weak-two bids and in responding to a reverse by partner. -- this is misleading. We should not say IT CAN or what others play. This text must say what we do play...

## After an overcall of a 1NT opening
Lebensohl can be initiated by responder after partner has opened 1NT and right hand opponent (RHO) has overcalled with a suit bid at the two level:

| Responder’s Bid | Meaning and Subsequent Bidding |
| --- | --- | 
| 2NT | relay bid, requiring opener to bid 3♣. After opener’s forced 3♣ bid:| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of a lower ranking suit than overcaller’s is natural, to play.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of a higher ranking suit than overcaller’s is natural and invitational.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of overcaller’s suit is artificial: like Stayman, it asks opener to bid a 4-card major, but it also shows a stopper in overcaller’s suit.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3NT is natural, to play, and shows† a stopper in overcaller’s suit.| 
| 3 of a suit other than overcaller’s | Natural, forcing to game | 
| 3 of overcaller’s suit | Artificial: like Stayman, it asks opener to bid a 4-card major, but it also denies† a stopper in overcaller’s suit | 
| 3NT | Natural, to play, and denies† a stopper in overcaller’s suit. If partner does not have stopper, he should bid the next cheapest suit | 
| Double | Penalty |

## When to use

## When NOT to use
- Opponent double 1NT. e.g. 1NT-X   transfer is on, Lebensohl is off
- Opponent interferes at 2NT or higher when partner opens 1NT.
- -- really? what if they preempt 3 hearts?

## After a Weak-two
After a Weak-two opening and a takeout double (please indicate the required points), Lebensohl is used to enable a better indication of the strength of the responder to the doubler.

For example after (2♠) – Dbl – (P):

- With 0-7 points 2NT is bid forcing a relay of 3♣. This is either passed or corrected to another suit.
- With 8-11 points suits are bid at the 3 level. -- is it forcing?
- With values for game it is bid. -- what do you mean?

If there is space to bid a suit at the 2 level; e.g. after (2♥) – Dbl – (P) and the suit held is spades:
- With 0-7 points bid 2♠
- With 8-11 points 2NT is bid forcing a relay of 3♣. Then 3♠ is bid showing the invite.
- 3♠ is now game forcing.

With a very strong hand the doubler can by-pass 3♣.

## When to use

## When NOT to use
-  Opponent raises after double e.g. (2♠) – Dbl – (3♠)
-  partner opens then opponent overcalls preemptively e.g. (1♦)-(2♠)

## After a non-game-forcing reverse
After the sequence 1♦ – (P) – 1♠ – (P); 2♥ – (P) – ?:

- 2♠ shows a weak hand with 5+ spades
- 2NT shows a minimum hand and forces 3♣. Preference is usually then given for openers suits.
- Any other bid is now game forcing.
This has the effect of saving space when responder wants to force game and show support.

- Need to discuss!
