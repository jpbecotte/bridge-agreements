# Lebensohl

Lebensohl is a contract bridge convention used by responder after an opponent's overcall of a one notrump (1NT) opening bid in order to compete further in the auction without necessarily committing the partnership to game. Lebensohl can also be used after opponents' weak-two bids and in responding to a reverse by partner.

##After an overcall of a 1NT opening
Lebensohl can be initiated by responder after partner has opened 1NT and right hand opponent (RHO) has overcalled with a suit bid at the two level:

| Responder’s Bid | Meaning and Subsequent Bidding |
| --- | --- | 
| 2NT | relay bid, requiring opener to bid 3♣. After opener’s forced 3♣ bid:| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of a lower ranking suit than overcaller’s is natural, to play.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of a higher ranking suit than overcaller’s is natural and invitational.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3 of overcaller’s suit is artificial: like Stayman, it asks opener to bid a 4-card major, but it also shows a stopper in overcaller’s suit.| 
| 2NT - 3♣ | 3NT is natural, to play, and shows† a stopper in overcaller’s suit.| 
| 3 of a suit other than overcaller’s | Natural, forcing to game | 
| 3 of overcaller’s suit | Artificial: like Stayman, it asks opener to bid a 4-card major, but it also denies† a stopper in overcaller’s suit | 
| 3NT | Natural, to play, and denies† a stopper in overcaller’s suit. If partner does not have stopper, he should bid the next cheapest suit |
