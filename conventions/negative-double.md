# Negative double
The negative double (aka Sputnik double) is made by the responder after his right-hand opponent overcalls on the first round of bidding,
and is used to show support for the unbid suits as well as some values. It is treated as forcing, but not unconditionally so. 


- 1♣ – (1♦) - X: 4+♠ and 4+♥ and 6+pts
- 1m – (1♥) - X: 4♠ and 6+pts
- 1m – (1♠) - X: 4+♥ and 6+pts
- 1M – (2m) - X: 4+ cards in the other major and 8+pts.
- 1♦ – (2♣) - X: 4+ cards in one major and 8+pts.
- 1♥ - (1♠) - X: 4+♦ and 4+♣ and 6+pts
- 1♠ - (2♥) - X: 4+♦ and 4+♣ and 8+pts


## When to use
- Opner opens in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th position
- Opponent preemptive bids e.g. 1♣ - 2♠ - X 

## When NOT to use
- opponent overcalls NT. e.g. 1♣/♦/♥/♠ – (1NT/2NT) - double is panety

## Questions :
- Should it be 8+tpts when opener is forced to talk at level 2?  -- Yes, that is better.
- Should 1♦ – (2♣) - X: show 4+cards in both majors?  -- it depends on partnership, we will discuss about it.

♠♥♦♣
