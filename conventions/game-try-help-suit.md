# Game try help suit

- A help suit game try (aka weak suit game try) may occur after an auction begins 1♥ : 2♥ or 1♠ : 2♠ (showing 8-9 pts)
When opener holds game-invitational values (15-17 points), 
he can bid a new suit at the cheapest level to say, "Partner, I'm interested in game, but I have weakness in this suit. Please bid game if you have a good holding in this suit." 
examples of suits meriting a help suit game try are:
- xxx(xx)
- Jxx(xx)
- Qxx(xx)
- QJx(xx)
- Kxx(xx)
- KJx(xx)
- Axx(xx)

Note that a help suit game try can be made with only a three-card suit, but it does not need to be alerted under ACBL tournament rules. 
After hearing a help suit game try, responder should bid game with 0 - 1.5 losers in the suit. (In other words, a first or second round control.) 
With 2 - 2.5 losers, responder must exercise judgement. 
And with 3 losers (e.g. a worthless tripleton), responder should sign off in 3♥/♠. 

New suit at level 4 is first round control cubid.


## When to use
- Open in majors at 1st/2nd position with 15-17 pts
- Opponent overcalls after responder bid 2♥/2♠ and open bid at level 3. e.g. 1♥ - P - 2♥ - X - 3♦/♣ ;   e.g. 1♥ - P - 2♥ - 3♣ - 3♦; 



## When NOT to use
- Opener in 3rd/4th position
- Opener bids a reverse bid. e.g. 1♥ - P - 2♥ - P - 2♠ (showing 18+ pts)
- Opponent overcalls opener. e.g. 1♠ - X - 2♠ (because the 2♠ here is not showing 8-9 pts) 
- Opponent overcalls after responder bid 2♥/2♠ and open bid at level 4(This is game forcing, cubid showing 1st round control). e.g. 1♥ - P - 2♥ - 2♠ - 4♦/♣ ;   e.g. 1♥ - P - 2♥ - 3♣ - 4♣/♦; 


♠♥♦♣
