## Unusual over unusual

Used when opponent bid something showing 2 suits:
 - Using 2NT Unusual
 - Michaels Cuebid (only when their bid show two suits, not one major and unspecified minor)

Warning: It's always good to asked opponents to verified the meaning of their bid.

Example:
 - 1♣ - 2♣ (shows majors)
 - 1♥ - 2NT (shows minors)
 
### How to use

First, determine what are the available cuebids.
Second, find the remaining suits.

 - Bidding a cuebid shows an invitational(11+ pts) hand. The lowest cuebid belongs to the lower remaining suit. The highest cuebid goes to the highest remaining suit.
 - A double says «intention de pénalité sur une des deux couleurs de l'adversaire»
 - Any other bid is to play

### Example

Example: 
- 1♥ - 2NT - 3♣ (11+ pts, fit in heart, invitationnal)
- 1♥ - 2NT - 3♦ (11+ pts, not fit in heart but 4 cards of spades, invitationnal)
- 1♥ - 2NT - 3♥ (6-10 pts, fit in heart)
- 1♥ - 2NT - 3♠ (6-10 pts, not fit in heart but 4 cards of spades)
- 1♥ - 2NT - 3NT (to play, stopping both minors... maybe not a good idea... maybe it's better to double)

## When NOT to use
- when one suit is not specified. e.g. 1♥ - 2♥ (shows spades and onther major)


 ♠♥♦♣
