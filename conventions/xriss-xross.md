# Xriss Xross

````
  m := a minor suit
  o := the other minor
````

When opener opens in minor, this convention help to find a good contract in minor or NT.

Responder options:
- A jump in the other minor shows a fit (5 cards) and 11 tpts. (Alertable)
- A jump in opener minor shows a fit and weak values. (Alertable)
- A single raise shows a fit and 6-10 tpts. (Natural)
- 1NT does not deny fit, but suggest a balanced hand.
- 2NT? 
- 3NT?

The continuation: after crossing in the other minor, the players show aces in other colors, the goal is to get to 3NT.

# When to use

- Opener is 1st or 2nd position and opens in minor.
- Responder denies a 4 major suit

# When NOT to use

- Opener is 3rd or 4th position
- Opponent interferes
