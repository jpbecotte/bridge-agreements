# New Minor Forcing

ALERTABLE 

This is on after a second bid of 1NT by opener, showing a minimum and balanced hand.

Ex: 1♣ - p - 1♥ - p - 1NT - ?

If responder bid the other minor, then it is artificial and forcing one round. It shows an invitational hand, and either 5 in the major or 4 in the other major.

## Opener response

```
Y := responder's major
W := other major
```

Priorities:
- 2Y => 3 in responder's major
- 2W => 4 in other major
- A bid that describe his hand best (2NT, 3 in minor,)

♠♥♦♣
