# DONT

« Do not let opponent play NT »

## When in use

- For interfering 1NT opening by opponents. 
- Only when their range is 15-17 or 15-18.
- For direct interference or after a PASS of opener's partner and PASS of partner.

## Bids

```
C := Any color except NT
```
2C promises 8tpts. Those points must be in the long suits bidded. (use the rule of eight, 6 high card pts is required) -http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Rule8.html

VUL: 5+ cards in both suits.
NOT VUL 5+ and 4+ cards in two suits.

- 2♣ : ♣ and another suit 
- 2♦ : ♦ and a major suit
- 2♥ : both majors
- 2♠ : natural
- X : 6 cards in an unspecified color

## Responder's responses

- Over 2C, responder must PASS if he has 2 or more cards of the suit.
- Else (either 0 or 1 card), he must bid the next available bid.
- Over X, responder MUST bid 2♣. It is a relay for interfere so he can bid his suit.

## Important

- If opponents talk, then the convention is over.
- 1NT- pass - 2♣/♦/♥, any bid after that is nature.

## When not to use
- opponent open weak 1NT (high range is 14 pts or lower)
- when partner opens then opponent overcalls 1NT e.g. 1♦ - 1NT  and 1♦ - pass - pass - 1NT
- when opponents opens 2NT

♠♥♦♣
