# DONT

« Do not let opponent play NT »

## When in use

- For interfering 1NT opening by opponents. 
- Only when their range is 15-17 or 15-18.
- For direct interference or after a PASS of opener's partner and PASS of partner.

## Bids

```
C := Any color except NT
```
2C promises 8pts. Those points must be in the long suits bidded.

- 2♣ : 5 clubs and 5 in another suit (Not nacessary 5 5 cards, 5 4 is also acceptable, the goal of DONT is to interfere opponents)
- 2♦ : 5 diamonds and 5 in majors
- 2♥ : both majors
- 2♠ : natural
- X : 6 cards in an unspecified color

## Responder's responses

- Over 2C, responder must PASS if he has 2 or more cards of the suit.
- Else (either 0 or 1 card), he must bid the next available bid.
- Over X, responder MUST bid 2♣. It is a relay for interfere so he can bid his suit.

## Important

- If opponents talk, then the convention is over.
