# Texas Transfers

Similar to Jacoby Transfers, but it promises 6 or more cards of transfered suit AND it is game forcing (obviously).

- 4♦ transfers to 4♥
- 4♥ transfers to 4♠

## When to use

1. Partner opens 1NT or 2NT
2. Partner overcalls 1NT
3. Partner opens 2♣ then bids 2NT as a second bid, showing 22-24 tpts

## When opponents get inside the auction...

This convention is very usefull to prevent or (better) stop opponents to put their nose in the auction. So it should always be ON. So the 4♦ and 4♥ will never be part of Lebenshol.

When opponent interfere, the system is ON till 3♠
- Example: 1NT/2NT - (3♥) - 4♥ is a texas transfer to spades with 6 spades, game forcing
- if opponent bid 4♦, X = transfer to ♥, 4♥ = transfer to ♠
- if opponent bid 4♥, X = transfer to ♠
- if opponent bid 4NT showing minors, X = prepare to penalty, 5♦ = transfer to ♥, 5♥ = transfer to ♠
