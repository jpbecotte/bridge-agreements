# Strong Jump Overcalls

A jump directly after a weak bid from opponents is strong. It shows at least 18tpts and 6 cards in suit and is forcing to game.

Ex:

- (2♥) - 3♠ 
- (2♦) - 3♥ 
- (2♠) - 4♣
- In the example above, partner may have passed.

Other situations:
- (1x) - p - (p) - jump in another color. This is called a balancing strong jump. It is a strong jump because RHO's pass is weak. It is balancing because in passed out seat. So, it shows 15+tpts (before balancer adds 3 points) and 6 cards in that suit.

## When to use
- RHO's bid is weak.


♠♥♦♣
