# Balancing

Balancing is an extension to any other convention that are in use. It is used to reduce the requirements of tpts need 
to bid when a player is in one particular position: the passed out seat.

## What is a passed out seat

A player is in the passed out seat if two passed has occured and if he pass, the auctions are over. One exception: first round: after three passes, the fourth player is not in balancing mode.

## When balancing is on

Both partners must realize that they are in balancing mode. If the balancer bids, then his partner must act accordingly.

When balancing is ON:
- Balancer adds 3 tpts to his hand and bid something with these 3tpts.
- Unless specified in this article, balancing mode does not tell anything about shape or suits. (the bid itself tells about that).
- Balancer's partner must deduce 3 tpts to make his respond bid.
- After points adjustment (+3/-3), these adjustments are in effect for the rest of the auctions.
