## Responses (by opener)

```
M := opener's major
Z := Any suit except M
```

- 3M means extra values (17-19 total pts with out singleton or void)
- 3Z means a splinter (this is not splinter, because splinter by opener promises 18+ pts, 3Z is 13+ pts with singlton or void)
- 4Z means a long and strong new suit (17+ points)
- 3NT shows extra and is better than 3M (extra extra wow,20-21 points)
