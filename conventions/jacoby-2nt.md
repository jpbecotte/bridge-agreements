# Jacoby 2NT

## How to use

By responder, shows 13pts with a 4 cards fit support in majors.

## Responses (by opener)

```
M := opener's major
Z := Any suit except M
```

- 3M means extra values (16-18 tpts with out singleton or void)
- 3Z means a splinter (this is not splinter, because splinter by opener promises 18+ pts, 3Z is 13+ pts with singlton or void -- NOT WITH 2NT JACOBY!!!!)
- 4Z means a long and strong new suit (13+ points)
- 3NT shows extra and is better than 3M (extra extra wow,19-21 points)

## When to use
- opponent overcalls at level 1. e.g. 1♥-1♥-2NT  the 2NT is Jacoby 2NT

## When NOT to use
- Opponent double
- Opponent interferes at level 2
-
