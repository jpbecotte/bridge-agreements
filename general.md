4. We use rule of 22 to open at 1st and 2nd seats

7. 1D-2C is not game forcing, promising 5 clubs and 10+ points.
8. Level 1 overcall promises (8 pts and honor(s)) or (13+ pts and 5 cards)
9. Level 2 overcall:
   Opponent open 1S, direct 2H = 10-16 pts, if >=17 pts double
   Opponent opens 1c, Pass, 1S, 2H = 13-16 pts 
10. 1nt balancing promises 12-15 points.
11. after take out double at level 1, 
   if opponent passes, raise = 0-8 pts; jump = 9+ pts 
   if opponent talks, pass = 0-4 pts; raise = 5-8 pts; jump = 9+ pts
12. Never lead under A against trump contract. 
    Lead under A against no trump contract is allowed.
