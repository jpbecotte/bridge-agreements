1. Total points calculation:
  * support points (sp): void 4, singleton 3, doubleton 1. Calculable only when fit is established.
  * length points (lp) : 1 point for each extra card from the 5th card. 
  * tpts is max(has_fit?(hcp + sp, 0), hcp + lp).
2. Points range(total points):
  * opening:
  	* 13-15 (including good 10,11,12 if the rule of 22 applies)
    * 16-18
    * 19-21	
  * responding:
    * 0-5 
    * 6-7
    * 8-10
    * 11-12
    * 13+
3. Points for games and slams
  * 3NT 25
  * 4H/S 26
  * 5C/D 29
  * small slam 33
  * big slam 37
4. We use rule of 22 to open at 1st and 2nd seats
5. We use rule of 15 to open at 3rd and 4th seats
6. We use total points for Bergen and Splinter.
7. 1D-2C is not game forcing, promising 5 clubs and 10+ points.
8. Level 1 overcall promises (8 pts and honor(s)) or (13+ pts and 5 cards)
9. Level 2 overcall:
   Opponent open 1S, direct 2H = 10-16 pts, if >=17 pts double
   Opponent opens 1c, Pass, 1S, 2H = 13-16 pts 
10. 1NT balancing promises 12-15 tpts.
11. After take out double at level 1, 
   if opponent passes, raise = 0-8 pts; jump = 9+ pts -- is it tpts?
   if opponent talks, pass = 0-4 pts; raise = 5-8 pts; jump = 9+ pts -- is it tpts ?
12. Never lead under A against trump contract. 
    Lead under A against no trump contract is allowed.
13. NEVER overcall with 4 cards
14. After Gerber or 1430, responder is the captain. NEVER overcall the captain's decision. -- disagree
15. If you ask for aces in a trump fit, and if you have 4 of the 5 keycards, there's an obligation to bid the small slam (you cannot retreat to the 5 level). In other words: don't ask for aces if you don't plan to go to at least the small slam with 4 keycards.
